SQL homework

TEST

This homework was a lot of fun to query the data and find the info requested, the joke at the end was very funny too, and well placed HAHA(this finding is also in the jupyter notebook)

I made an ERD showing the relationship between the tables. You can find this in the images folder. I had the 'Employees' table as the main reference piece for the diagram. The 'titles' and 'salaries' tables only need the employee number off of the main table. The 'Departments' table, along with the main table,was referenced by the 'dept_emp' and 'dept_manager' tables. I find ERD's tough but did find it helpful!!

I have 3 SQL files for the pgadmin in a folder. One is the schemata, one is the queires and one is everything combined. this I really enjoyed. I am a big fan of SQL.

in the jupyter notebook you will find the bonus work with the histogram and the bar chart
and also the employee 499942 name again

the csv files are just the files from the hw folder copied so I could use from that local destination.
