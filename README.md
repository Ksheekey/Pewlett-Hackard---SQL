SQL homework

TEST

This homework was a lot of fun to query the data and fint he info requested, the joke at the end was very funny too, and well placed HAHA.

I made an ERD showing the relationship between the tables. I had the 'Employees' table as the main reference piece for the diagram. The 'titles' and 'salaries' tables only need the employee number off of the main table. The 'Departments' table, along with the main table,was referenced by the 'dept_emp' and 'dept_manager' tables. I find ERD's tough but did find it helpful!!
