SQL homework

TEST

This homework was a lot of fun to query the data and fint he info requested, the joke at the end was very funny too, and well placed HAHA.

I made an ERD showing the relationship between the tables. I had the 'Employees' table as the main reference piece for the diagram. The 'titles' and 'salaries' tables only need the employee number off of the main table. The 'Departments' table, along with the main table,was referenced by the 'dept_emp' and 'dept_manager' tables. I find ERD's tough but did find it helpful!!

I tried for hours... and I mean HOURSSSSS trying to find a way to import the databse into pandas/jupyter notebook so I could do the bonus portion but couldn't. So i'm left without being able to do that part which I am upset about. 

I could not find in class lessons, where we were taught how to save a file as a sqlite.
I could not find in class lessons, where we were taught to transfer data to sqlite so it could be read on pandas
I could not figure out how to use the example code given in the readme to import into pandas
I could not find in class lessons, where we were taught to import an SQL file.

We learned all about SQL files, and we learned all about importing sqlite files. but never, at least through memory and revisiting class videos, how to make the files similar. I even spent a while on the DB Browser for sqlite and couldnt get the data to show up without importing each and everything all over again, but if I am going to do that I mind as well just import the csv's into pandas and do it that way, but that was not what you were looking for.
